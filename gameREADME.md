## How To Play
****************************************************************************************************
- Flip Over **Cards** and try to successfully find a match
- If you don't find a match, both cards will flip back down after you flip them over(try to memorize their locations)
- The amount of stars you get for your play depends on how many moves(says how many on game) it takes you.
- The objective of the game is to flip over cards and try to make matches as quick as possible so you can achieve a success of 3 stars.
